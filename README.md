# Snake_Game
A simple Python Snake Game where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow longer. Tasks include: creating the snake's body, programming movement, controlling it with arrow keys, detecting food collision to grow, adding a scoreboard, and ending the game if the snake hits walls or its own tail.
