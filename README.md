Snake Game in Python
This project is a simple Python implementation of the classic Snake Game using the turtle module. The game involves controlling a snake to eat food and grow, while avoiding collisions with walls and its own tail. The code is structured into separate files for each major task, following Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and functional programming principles.

Project Structure
The game is broken down into the following parts, with each part in a separate file:

1 - Snake Body (snake.py)
    Implements the snake's body using OOP with the turtle module to visualize the snake segments.

2 - Move the Snake
    Automatically moves the snake on the screen using turtle, updating its position based on direction.

3 - Control the Snake
    Allows the player to control the snake's direction using arrow keys.

4 - Collision with Food (food.py)
    Detects when the snake eats food. The snake grows, and new food appears at a random location.

5 - Scoreboard (scoreboard.py)
    Displays and updates the player's score using turtle for visualization.

6 - Collision with Wall
    Ends the game if the snake collides with the wall.

7 - Collision with Tail
    Ends the game if the snake collides with its own body.

Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
{git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game.git}
cd snake-game
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
{ pip install -r requirements.txt }
Make sure Pythonâ€™s turtle module is available. It's included with the standard Python library, so no additional installation should be necessary.

How to Run
To start the game, run the main Python file:

bash
Copy code
{python main.py}
Use the arrow keys to control the snake. The goal is to eat the food, grow the snake, and avoid hitting the walls or the snake's tail.

Files
1- main.py: The main game loop and integration of all components.
2- snake.py: Contains the snake class, which handles movement, growing, and collision.
3 -food.py: Handles food generation and placement.
4- scoreboard.py: Displays and updates the score.
requirements.txt: Lists the required Python packages.
